# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
uses a feedforward Neural Net to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

This program uses Processing 3.4 but is mostly plain Java

To run:
NN2_han... is the main file. run it. training takes really long.
I've gotten pretty good results with 30 epochs, 250 mini batch size and 1.0 learning rate.
